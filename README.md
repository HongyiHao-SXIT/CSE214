# CSE214 - Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (Stony Brook College, Anhui University, New York)

## I. Course Overview
CSE214 is an introductory course focusing on data structures and algorithms. Data structures are methods of organizing data in unique ways to solve complex computational problems, while algorithms are means of developing solutions for various computational problems. In this course, you will primarily learn about the major data structures commonly used in most programming systems, such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Additionally, you will study fundamental algorithms for data searching and sorting and learn how to evaluate the efficiency of these (and other) algorithms.

## II. Course Details

### (I) Course Description
This course is an extension of programming methodology, emphasizing data storage and manipulation on complex data sets. The course covers the following topics:
1. **Programming and Applications of Data Structures**: Including stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, heaps, priority queues, balanced trees, and graphs.
2. **Recursive Programming**: Recursive programming methods are extensively used.
3. **Fundamental Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: The course studies fundamental sorting and searching algorithms and conducts informal efficiency comparisons.

### (II) Learning Objectives
1. **Enhanced Programming Experience**: Provide students with more programming practice using an object - oriented language (Java), especially focusing on large - scale programs that require the use of sophisticated data structures.
2. **Deepened Conceptual Understanding**: Strengthen students' understanding of abstract data types, pointers, recursion, and algorithmic design.
3. **Efficiency Awareness Cultivation**: Introduce students to the importance of time and memory efficiency in algorithm design.

### (III) Credits
This course is worth 4 credits.

### (IV) Prerequisites/Entrance Requirements
To enroll in CSE214 this semester, you must meet the following prerequisite:
Complete CSE114 with a grade of C or better. Students who do not meet the prerequisites will not be permitted to take CSE214. (Students already registered for CSE214 who do not meet the prerequisites will be deregistered by the Computer Science department.)

## III. Key Course Content

### (I) Data Structures
1. **Linear Structures**
    - **Lists**: Master the basic operations of lists, such as inserting, deleting, and searching for elements. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different types of lists (e.g., array lists and linked lists).
    - **Stacks and Queues**: Learn the principles of Last - In - First - Out (LIFO) for stacks and First - In - First - Out (FIFO) for queues. Implement basic operations of stacks and queues and understand their applications in real - world problems.
2. **Tree Structures**
    - **Binary Trees**: Study the definition, traversal methods (pre - order, in - order, post - order traversal), and basic operations (inserting and deleting nodes) of binary trees.
    - **Heaps and Priority Queues**: Understand the properties and implementation of heaps, and master the basic concepts and operations of priority queues.
    - **Balanced Trees**: Learn about the balancing mechanisms and application scenarios of balanced trees (e.g., AVL trees, red - black trees).
3. **Graph Structures**: Master the representation methods (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), traversal algorithms (depth - first search, breadth - first search) of graphs, and their applications in solving real - world problems.

### (II) Algorithms
1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Study common sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, merge sort, and heapsort. Analyze their time and space complexities and conduct efficiency comparisons.
2. **Searching Algorithms**: Learn basic searching algorithms, such as linear search and binary search. Understand the principles and applications of hash tables and how to handle hash collisions.

## IV. Learning Suggestions
1. **Review Java Knowledge**: Since the course assumes you have prior knowledge of Java programming, it is recommended to review the basics of Java, including object - oriented programming, classes and objects, inheritance, and polymorphism before the course starts.
2. **Combine Theory with Practice**: Data structures and algorithms are highly practical subjects. Strengthen your understanding of theoretical knowledge through a large number of programming exercises. Try to implement the data structures and algorithms learned in the course by yourself, and conduct testing and optimization.
3. **Understand Concepts Thoroughly**: For concepts such as abstract data types, pointers, and recursion, understand their principles and application scenarios in depth. You can deepen your understanding by reading relevant textbooks and reference materials and discussing with classmates and teachers.
4. **Analyze Algorithm Efficiency**: When learning algorithms, pay attention to analyzing their time and space complexities. Learn to use the Big - O notation to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms and select appropriate algorithms according to specific problems.

## V. Academic Integrity Notice
Academic integrity is of utmost importance in this course. You are expected to uphold the highest standards of honesty and ethical behavior in all your academic work. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty are strictly prohibited.

- **Plagiarism**: Do not copy someone else's work, including code, essays, or research, and present it as your own. All assignments and projects must be your original work. If you use external sources, make sure to properly cite them.
- **Cheating**: Do not seek unauthorized assistance during exams or quizzes. This includes using notes, electronic devices, or communicating with others in an inappropriate way.
- **Collaboration**: While some group work may be encouraged, make sure that you understand the boundaries of collaboration. Each student is responsible for their own learning and contribution to the group.

Violations of academic integrity will result in serious consequences, including but not limited to a failing grade for the assignment, course, or even disciplinary action from the university. By participating in this course, you agree to abide by the academic integrity policies of the institution.
